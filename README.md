## Known Issues
- as of 2025-02-01, Tailwind v4 has been released, but shadcn/ui does not officially support Tailwind v4 yet.
    - [Related Issue](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/discussions/2996)
    - [shadcn progress in upgrading to v4](https://github.com/shadcn/app-tailwind-v4)
    - best not to use shadcn/ui yet until v4 is officially supported
        - tho for now copy and pasted `globals.css` to our `index.css` from `shadcn/app-tailwind-v4`
    - shadcn is LOCKED IN and working on it
